					<h6>History of the industry</h6><!-- headline-->
					<p>
              Gaming in Australia started with the formation of Beam Software in 1978 by Alfred Milgrom and Naomi Besen. After they secured the rights, they released a game based on The Hobbit by J.R. Tolkien in 1982, which
              became a massive success in Europe. Following this, the late 80s and early 90s saw an influx in Australian game developers, with Micro Forté selling over 60,000 copies of their game, America's Cup Sailing Simulation.<br><br>
              Following the success of these studios, the mid-late 90s saw the birth of several game developers in Australia of varying sizes. In 2000, Irrational Games opened a studio in Canberra, which contributed to two
              critically acclaimed games. In this same year, the Victorian Government established the 'Game Plan Initiative' to assist game developers in Australia.<br><br>
              Unfortunately, the success would not last, as by 2018,
              every AAA studio opened in Australia would close for varying reasons, leaving the country with no AAA developers. Although, the recent indie boom has given rise to several Australian-based mobile game developers, with some attaining
              worldwide success, including Halfbrick Studios (Fruit Ninja, Jetpack Joyride), Hipster Whale (Crossy Road) and several others.

					<h6>The Industry Now</h6><!-- Headline -->
					<p>
            In regard to consumers and retailers, the gaming industry is growing like never before in Australia. In 2014, revenue in the gaming industry was up to
            $2.46B, and hardware sales grew by 47%. This has lead to the demand in Australia for more game consoles and brick-and-mortar stores for buying consumer
            gaming products, which shows a massive trend in the acceptance and development of the gaming industry in Australia, despite the government being reluctant
            to support or endorse it. The industry is leading the world and is providing Australia with an enormous economic boost.
            <br><br>
            However, for independant game studios the news isn't as lucky. Following the Australian government cutting funding to Australian game developers in 2014,
            some developers are finding difficulty staying afloat in the game development landscape. As well as that, the loss of all AAA studios in Australia sent a
            message that the Australian market prefers to cosume gaming content rather than deliver it.
            <br><br>
            Although, Australian independant developers have had quite considerable success on mobile platforms, and that continues to be the trend for Australian game developers
            at this time. But hopefully, soon enough, game developers in Australia will expand outside of the mobile bracket and branch back into AAA games, bringing 
            big-budget gaming experiences with an Australian touch to the global market.
